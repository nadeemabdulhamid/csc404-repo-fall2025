## Step 2 - Grammar

Write out a complete grammar for your language, based on your sample programs you provided in Step 1.

The grammar should be written using notation similar to the combined [Lox grammar](../lox-grammar.md). (This does not mean your grammar of your language needs to be like Lox's. I mean use the BNF notation like the Lox grammar.)
