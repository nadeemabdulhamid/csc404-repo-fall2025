# Build-Your-Own-Language

## Final Stage & Presentation

In lieu of our last class meeting and a final exam, you will have your final, working interpreters on display and available for demonstration at the HackBerry TechExpo on **Dec. 5 from 3:30 - 5:00 p.m**. The TechExpo will be an open table format, and we will try to grab some open spots at one or a couple of tables close to each other to set up at.

You should have your interpreter running on your laptop to demonstrate to visitors and (preferably) allow them to interact with your language as well.

You should also develop a poster (17" x 11" - tabloid size) to display on the table as well. Use Apple Pages/Adobe InDesign/Powerpoint/Keynote to design a professional-looking poster giving an overview of your language, the motivation behind it, and samples of code. You may use the following as a template for the overall layout. Be sure to include the [**Berry logo**](https://berry.edu/marketing/brand/logos), the **number and name of this course**, names of the **members of your group**, and a link to your **Github repo**.

You should be prepared to explain in layperson's terms the stages involved with implementing your language. You probably should also have some interesting examples of scripts in your language to have on hand to demonstrate.
