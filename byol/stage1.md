# Build-Your-Own-Language

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **programming language** of your own. It does not need to have a ton of features, but should have non-trivial features (such as some form of control flow, procedures, and user-definable data types in addition to built-in). There are generally two directions to go in:

- Design a special purpose language ("domain specific language") for expressing and solving a particular type of computational problem or need.

- Design a (minimal) *general purpose* language (along the lines of Lox) but with some interesting syntax (and/or semantics). "Interesting" means it experiments with some alternative approach to syntax than mainstream languages that is motivated by making things easier/more intuitive/more powerful for the user.

## Step 1 - Requirements

Generate the following:

- A name for your language (e.g. "Lox") and filename extension (e.g. ".lox")
- A short 3-4 sentence description of its purpose
- Examples of programs/scripts in your language demonstrating the syntax and illustrating mockup outputs (terminal print outs, files generated, graphics produced, etc)

As you work on coming up with sample programs, you should be continuously thinking in the back of your head about everything we've covered about implementing an interpreter for a langauge. The more time, effort, and attention to detail you put into coming up with a clear, focused, and reasonable language design now, the easier the rest of the project will be.

## Sample Proposal

> (Some of this generated by Copilot based on the instructions above, but heavily edited by Nadeem Abdul Hamid.)

**Language Name:** Quokka (apparently named after [the world's happiest animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka))<br>
**Filename Extension:** .qk

**Description:**
Quokka is a beginner-friendly, general-purpose programming language designed to make learning programming concepts intuitive and fun. Its syntax is inspired by natural language, making it easy to read and write, especially for those new to coding. Quokka supports basic control flow, user-defined functions, and simple data structures, with a focus on immediate feedback and playful experimentation. The language is ideal for educational settings and rapid prototyping of small ideas.

**Example Program 1: Hello, World!**
```qk
say "Hello, world!".
Say "Hello, world!".           [note -- case insensitive. and this is a comment]
```
*Output:*
```
Hello, world!
```

**Example Program 2: Factorial Function**
```qk
factorial is a function that takes a number n and produces a number:
if n is less than equal 1 then produce 1
otherwise produce n times factorial of (n minus 1).

show factorial of 5.
```
*Output:*
```
120
```

**Example Program 3: List and Loop**
```qk
numbers is a list of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
sum is the number 0.
for each number n in numbers, set sum to sum plus n
Say "The sum is " and sum.
```
*Output:*
```
The sum is 15
```

**Example Program 4: User-Defined Compound Data Type (Record/Struct)**
```qk
Person is a type with fields name and age.

alice is a Person with name "Alice" and age 30.
bob is a Person with name "Bob" and age 25.

people is a list of alice and bob.

for each person p in people,
	Say p's name and " is " and p's age and " years old.".
```
*Output:*
```
Alice is 30 years old.
Bob is 25 years old.
```
