# Extension Project 3

**Choose up to three** of these tasks to complete. If you need help breaking them down further to get started, please let me know! It would help if you start on these early so that you can ask for feedback.

In addition to your code in your repository, you should write a `readme-project3.md` (Markdown) file that explain which option/s you worked on and what you did for each one. Summarize the main changes you made to the source code and how you tested them. How can someone else see/test the results of your work?

In class, a random couple of people will be asked to present your work on each of these.


## Options 1/2 - Interpreting Comma/Conditional Operators

If you implemented the comma/conditional operator option(s) in the last project, follow through with implementing their semantics in the interpreter (based on either chapter 7, 8, or 9 versions of the book's code).

## Option 3 - `break` / `continue`

[Challenge #3](https://craftinginterpreters.com/control-flow.html#challenges) in Chapter 9.

## Option 4 - Uninitialized Variables

[Challenge #2](https://craftinginterpreters.com/statements-and-state.html#challenges) in Chapter 8.
