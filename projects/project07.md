# Extension Project 7

In addition to your code in your repository, you should write a `readme-project7.md` (Markdown) file that explain which option/s you worked on and what you did for each one. Summarize the main changes you made to the source code and how you tested them. How can someone else see/test the results of your work? Your readme should also contain any citations of sources, or credit/prompts used for generative AI.

In class, a random couple of people will be asked to present your work on each of these.

## Parsing a Ternary Operator

Complete Challenge 3 in Chapter 17.


## Concatentating String with Other Types

> (Discussed in Chapter 19. You'll need to update your project with Chapter 19 code.)

Implement support so that expressions like: 

```
> "hello" + 123
> 1 + "world"
> true + " fact"
```

implicit convert the non-string value to a string and return the concatenation.
