# Extension Project 7

In addition to your code in your repository, you should write a `readme-project7.md` (Markdown) file that explain which option/s you worked on and what you did for each one. Summarize the main changes you made to the source code and how you tested them. How can someone else see/test the results of your work? Your readme should also contain any citations of sources, or credit/prompts used for generative AI.

In class, a random couple of people will be asked to present your work on each of these.
