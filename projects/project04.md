# Extension Project 4

**Choose one or two** of these tasks to complete.

In addition to your code in your repository, you should write a `readme-project4.md` (Markdown) file that explain which option/s you worked on and what you did for each one. Summarize the main changes you made to the source code and how you tested them. How can someone else see/test the results of your work? Your readme should also contain any citations of sources, or credit/prompts used for generative AI.

In class, a random couple of people will be asked to present your work on each of these.

## Option 1 - Native Functions

Implement two or three useful native functions. You may propose your own idea to me for approval, or choose from these:

- A function `read()` to read input strings from the user
- A function `num(s)` to convert strings to numbers
- A function `str(v)` to convert any other Lox type to a strings (in a sensible way)
- A function `type(v)` that returns the type of a Lox value as a string ("number", "string", "bool", "nil", "function")
- A function `exit()` that terminates the program 
- A function `echo(v)` that prints a value and returns it (helps in debugging)

## Option 2 - Unused variables
